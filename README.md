This project is a jump-starter for the Kotlin programming language.  It borrows heavily from the [Kotlin language documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/),
so it could more accurately be called Kotlin for the Lazy :-)

This project uses [Spek](http://spekframework.org/) and JUnit.
To build this project you can simply use Gradle.  Execute `./gradlew clean build` to
build the project and execute the tests.

Running the tests in Intellij requires installing the [Spek plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8564-spek).
